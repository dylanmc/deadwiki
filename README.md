# deadwiki

_Dead simple personal wiki._

**deadwiki** is a Markdown-powered wiki that uses your filesystem to
store all its wiki pages. This means you can keep your wiki in a git
repository and edit them with your text editor, or through a web
interface.

There are three built-in ways to access it:

- Local webserver with a super basic HTML UI
- Native WebView app
- Just use your filesystem. Regular Markdown files.

- [x] Directory of Markdown files
- [x] Render Page
- [x] Render raw page
- [x] Link to other page
- [ ] JS editor
- [ ] Edit page
- [ ] Create page
