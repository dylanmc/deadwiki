# deadwiki

_a dead simple personal wiki_

**deadwiki** is a Markdown-powered wiki that uses your filesystem as
its db. This means you can keep your wiki in a git repository and edit
content with your text editor, or read and modify pages _with style_
using its 1990s-era web interface.

There are three built-in ways to access your deadwiki:

- Via local webserver and static HTML UI.
- Via native WebView app that wraps the UI.
- Just use your filesystem. Regular Markdown files. `cat`, `ls`, etc.

## WebView

- [ ] Wrap HTML server
- [ ] macOS app
- [ ] macOS icon
