# Welcome to deadwiki

Hello, and welcome.

There are many things you can do with deadwiki. Start by double clicking this page (if you're using the web UI) to start editing it.

deadwiki supports all of [CommonMark] and includes two wikitastic additions: 

1. Normally when a word is alone in brackets like `[Snippet]`, it's assumed to be a footnote. In deadwiki, however, if there's no matching footnote, it'll turn into a wiki link - either to an existing page, or a form to make a new one. Standard wiki stuff.
2. Hashtags like `#markdown` are linked to a search page that lists all pages containing that hashtag.

- Existing page: [Snippets]
- New page: [Some page that doesn't exist]
- Hashtag: #markdown

Check out the [README] for more. 

Enjoy!
